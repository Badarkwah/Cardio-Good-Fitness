# Cardio Good Fitness Project 🏋️‍♂️🚴

## Project Overview 📈
Cardio Good Fitness aims to deepen its understanding of customer preferences and behaviors regarding treadmill products. This repository hosts an AI/ML project designed to parse through customer data to unveil patterns that could assist in refining product offerings and marketing strategies.

## Objectives 🎯
- Develop a comprehensive analysis to understand customer demographics, usage patterns, and fitness levels.
- Identify key factors that influence the purchase decision of different treadmill models.
- Segment customers based on their preferences and potential for engagement with the products.

## Data Insights 📊
The project meticulously examines customer data, including but not limited to age, income, fitness levels, and product preferences, to distill actionable insights:
- Key variables such as `Age`, `Income`, `Education`, and `Fitness` level offer insights into the customer base.
- Analysis aims at uncovering relationships between customer attributes and their preferences for treadmill models.

## Mission 🚀
By highlighting the characteristics of customers preferring different treadmill models, this initiative supports targeted marketing and product development efforts, aiming to boost customer satisfaction and engagement.

## Data Dictionary 📚
The dataset comprises various customer attributes:
- `Product`: Treadmill model number.
- `Age`: Customer's age in years.
- `Gender`: Customer's gender.
- `Education`: Years of education.
- `Marital Status`: Marital status.
- `Usage`: Average weekly usage of the treadmill.
- `Fitness`: Self-rated fitness score (1-5).
- `Income`: Annual income.
- `Miles`: Expected miles to run.

## Data Preparation 🛠️
- Initial data examination and cleaning using `pandas`.
- Data visualization to explore distributions and relationships with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Statistical analysis to identify patterns and insights.

## Models 📊
While this project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), the methodologies and insights pave the way for future predictive modeling, potentially employing:
- **Regression Analysis**: To predict customer engagement based on demographics and treadmill usage.
- **Cluster Analysis**: For customer segmentation based on usage patterns and preferences.

## Model Evaluation 📝
